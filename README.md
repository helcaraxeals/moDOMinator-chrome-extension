# moDOMinator chrome extension

The chrome extension acts as an entity to detect state changes to the app, identify new DOM elements rendered and use [moDOMinator](https://github.com/tanhengyeow/moDOMinator) to scan the DOM elements for web vulnerabilities. See how [moDOMinator-example-apps](https://github.com/tanhengyeow/moDOMinator-example-apps) use this chrome extension.

The extension is a WIP and not ready to be published to the Chrome web store. For development purposes, fork/clone this repository and follow the steps highlighted in the section `Create the manifest` of this [guide](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).

# Build the app

```
npm start
```

**-Work in Progress-**
